DylanSeating.js
===============

This is an experiment with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [Soket.IO](http://socket.io/) and [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.com/).

The premise is to make a really basic navigation. No right clicks, no peculiar quasimods. Just a straight forward rich exciting UI.

After being inspired by new fangled awsome sites like [Trello](http://trello.com) I thought collaberation would be a perfect match to a table planner, brides and grooms can design their seating plan for their big day with the minimum of fuss.

Example Site

I have created a free Heroku to test the product.

Help Wanted
===========

Please - if you are inspired by this project you can help!

I always am happy to discuss coding practice, but I would love anyone to contribute with the following skills...

 * Nice textures. Have a lovely tiling wood effect? Drop me a file!
 * Performance tuning. Do you know quadtree? Show me!
 * Accessibility advice. Are you blind? Tell me how would you plan an event!

If you have any feedback then let me know.
